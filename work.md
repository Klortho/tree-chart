Current work
============

It is time to start seeing pretty boxes.

* (/)demo needs to instantiate a TreeChart
* (/)and initialize a tree (no text)

* Get the chart to draw the tree.
    * TreeChart has to do it's initialization voodoo.
    
    * Let's try not wrapping the Node objects. If need be, attach metadata
      using a Symbol.



* ticker should then morph the tree
