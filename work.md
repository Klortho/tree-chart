To do:

# Queue

* Strategy:
    * Get default TreeChart options into a separate module, without much real
      data yet, integrated with config1, and tested
    * Then TDD: start the demo index.html page, and develop as needed to make
      it work.


* randomly change the colors and/or other style attributes
* slow motion
* add a "legend" with:
    * current state
    * description of keyboard shortcuts

# Current work

* Word list - 1/2 hour - 10:40
    * I just want a function that returns a new random word whenever called.
