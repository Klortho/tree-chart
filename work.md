# Queue

* Strategy:
    * No words in the basic library. But keep that stuff around, split into
      separate files.
    * The demo is based on config1 too (natch) and extensible
    * Then TDD: start the demo index.html page, and develop as needed to make
      it work.


* randomly change the colors and/or other style attributes
* slow motion
* add a "legend" with:
    * current state
    * description of keyboard shortcuts



Current work
============

## Demo

* First create a main method that creates the TreeChart object

* Create a TextTree class, that implements everything specific to the demo.
