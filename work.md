To do:

* Take dependencies out of vendor -- use node_modules if at all possible.
* Separate out, and test, the word list utilities
* randomly change the colors
* slow motion
* add a key with:
    * current state
    * description of shortcuts

* make sure it is rock-solidly robust.
    * check for memory leaks
* get it to work from webpack
* Move tester.js into a separate library, funcutils.
